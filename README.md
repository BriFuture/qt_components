## Componets List

### Communicator

A simple, useful communicator aims at simplify communicating between PCs and MCUs, it contains SerialPort, Network, Bluetooth (although not finished yet) and a simple Virtual COM (it is uncomplete like Bluthooth, but can simulate a basic com).

[Here](https://brifuture.github.io/qt_components/basic_communicator/docs) is a simple documents for it.

**TODO**

* Use a xml that can be used by VirtualCom, Let VirtualCom choose a certain XML to _simulate a Certain MCU_, which means that it can completely response as a real MCU do when receiving a command by caller.
* Finish Bluetooth feature. In fact, My Computer does not support Bluetooth, it is a little hard for me to add this feature.
